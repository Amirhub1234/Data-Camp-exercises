What if your data is split into multiple groups spread over one or more columns in the table? Even with a defined frame, if you can't somehow separate the groups' data, one group's values will affect the average of another group's values.
<Moving Average>

Calculate the 3-year moving sum and Average of medals earned per country.

WITH Country_Medals AS (

  SUM(medals) OVER
    (PARTITION BY Country
