 NTILE(n)
 
 Splitting your data into thirds or quartiles is often useful to understand how the values in your dataset are spread. Getting summary statistics (averages, sums, standard deviations, etc.) of the top, middle, and bottom thirds can help you determine what distribution your values follow.

-Split the athletes into top, middle, and bottom thirds based on their count of medals. 

WITH Athlete_Medals AS (
  SELECT Athlete, COUNT(*) AS Medals
  FROM Summer_Medals
  GROUP BY Athlete
  HAVING COUNT(*) > 1)
  
SELECT
  Athlete,
  Medals,
  -- Split athletes into thirds by their earned medals
  NTILE(3) OVER (ORDER BY Medals DESC) AS Third
FROM Athlete_Medals
ORDER BY Medals DESC, Athlete ASC;


-Return the average of each third.

WITH Athlete_Medals AS (
  SELECT Athlete, COUNT(*) AS Medals
  FROM Summer_Medals
  GROUP BY Athlete
  HAVING COUNT(*) > 1),
  
  Thirds AS (
  SELECT
    Athlete,
    Medals,
    NTILE(3) OVER (ORDER BY Medals DESC) AS Third
  FROM Athlete_Medals)
  
SELECT
  -- Get the average medals earned in each third
  Third,
  AVG(Medals) AS Avg_Medals
FROM Thirds
GROUP BY Third
ORDER BY Third ASC;
