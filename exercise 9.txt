# Fintech SQL Project – User Analytics with PostgreSQL

## Overview
This project showcases a beginner-to-intermediate level SQL analysis task using a fictional fintech database. The goal is to identify the **top 5 high-value users** based on their total transaction amounts, account types, and location.

## Objective
> "Write a SQL query that returns the top 5 users with the highest total transaction values, including the number of transactions, their account type, and their city."

## Tables Used
- `users` – contains user profile data
- `accounts` – contains account details per user
- `transactions` – records of financial transactions

## Output Columns
- `full_name`
- `account_type`
- `city`
- `total_transactions` – number of transactions per user
- `total_spent` – sum of transaction amounts (including negative values)

## SQL Concepts Used
- JOINs across multiple tables
- GROUP BY and aggregation
- COUNT and SUM
- ORDER BY and LIMIT
- Aliases and clean output formatting

## SQL Query
```sql
SELECT 
  u.full_name,
  u.city,
  a.account_type,
  COUNT(t.transaction_id) AS total_transactions,
  SUM(t.amount) AS total_spent
FROM users AS u
JOIN accounts AS a ON u.user_id = a.user_id
JOIN transactions AS t ON a.account_id = t.account_id
GROUP BY u.user_id, u.full_name, u.city, a.account_type
ORDER BY total_spent DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

## Query Result

| full_name         | account_type | city     | total_transactions | total_spent |
|-------------------|--------------|----------|---------------------|-------------|
| Mohammad Jafari   | Savings      | Tabriz   | 1                   | 1000000.00  |
| Hossein Mohammadi | Savings      | Mashhad  | 1                   | 250000.00   |
| Ali Rezaei        | Savings      | Tehran   | 2                   | 100000.00   |
| Fatemeh Karimi    | Joint        | Isfahan  | 1                   | -300000.00  |
| Sara Ahmadi       | Current      | Shiraz   | 1                   | -500000.00  |
